from pyanten.Utility import frequencyToWavelength

def miniumumRange(frequency: float):
  r""" Minimum recommended distance for near-field antenna measurements in meters

  Parameters
  ----------
  frequency : float
      frequency of interest in Hertz [Hz]

  Notes
  -----
  Standard suggests to choose between 3 or 5 wavelength.
  In order to ensure copuling effect, 5 wavelength distance is choosen and implemented.
